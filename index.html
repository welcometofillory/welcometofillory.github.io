<h3 id="welcome">Background</h3>   
<p>Fillory is a magical world created by <strong>Ember</strong> and <strong>Umber</strong>, two twin gods, both currently deceased. Ember was the Fillorian god of Chaos, responsible for the more whimsical aspects of Fillory, while Umber was the Fillorian god of Order, in charge of the more technical details. The name refers to the landmass, which is conical in shape, as well as one of the sovereign states.<br><br>
According to Calypso, the nymph responsible for creating Castle Blackspire, rather than making Fillory from scratch, Ember and Umber <strong>took an existing world and flipped it</strong>, working on the other side.</p>

<p>Some of the known locations in Fillory are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Abyss</strong>: an uncharted area over the ocean where it is always night
	<li><strong>After Island</strong>: a recently-declared province of Fillory where the first Golden Key is found
	<li><strong>Castle Blackspire</strong>: a prison located on the underside of Fillory built to hold the creature created by the Old Gods. It's also known as <em>The Castle at the End of the World</em> and contains a fountain which, if activated by the <em>Seven Golden Keys</em>, would act as a backdoor for magic in the case that the Wellspring was shut off
	<li><strong>Castle Whitespire</strong>: headquarters for the Fillorian High Council
	<li><strong>Chatwin’s Torrent</strong>: a magical healing river attended by J.P. Manoux
	<li><strong>Clock Barrens</strong>: a grove of <em>clock trees</em> erected by Jane Chatwin to study time magic
	<li><strong>Ember’s Temple</strong>: where Ember fled to in order to hide from Martin Chatwin
	<li><strong><a href="#allegiances">Floating Mountain</a></strong>: neighboring kingdom
	<li><strong>Flying Forest</strong>: a forest filled with fumes that drugs anyone who enters, erasing certain memories and making them temporarily inebriated
	<li><strong><a href="#allegiances">Loria</a></strong>: kingdom that borders Fillory to the north
	<li><strong>Outer Island</strong>: an island that haven't paid their taxes to the Fillorian court in 46 years
	<li><strong>Rainbow Bridge</strong>: a bridge made out of flowers that leads to the area of Fillorian coronation
</ul>

<p>Another interesting difference between Fillory and Earth is the atmosphere; the air contains 0.2% opium.</p>

<h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>     
<div><p>One of the defining features of Fillory is its <strong>abundance of magic</strong>. At its peak, the kingdom was populated with many different creatures, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>talking animals, such as horses and elephants
	<li>pegasi
	<li>satyrs
</ul>
<p>Along with these, there are seven <strong>Questing Creatures</strong>, also known as <em>Unique Beasts</em>, that grant wishes to anyone who captures or corners them. They were created by Ember and Umber, and include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Dog</strong>
	<li><strong>The Great Cock</strong>: brother of the White Lady, a peacock that can sense magical items, across all the worlds, which may be useful for those who capture him
	<li><strong>Otter</strong>: an otter that can provide an object that brings one to Fillory
	<li><strong>Pig</strong>
	<li><strong>Rabbit</strong>: a messenger rabbit which announces <em>Fen's</em> pregnancy
	<li><strong>Seventh Beast</strong>
	<li><strong>The White Lady</strong>: a white doe that grants three wishes to whoever captures her
</ul>
<p>For most of its history, Ember and Umber were the patron gods of Fillory, but after their disappearances/ deaths, the Fillorians began to worship a goddess named <strong>Our Lady of the Tree</strong>, who regrew the Sentient Tree Forest. On Earth, she is known by her birth name, Julia Wicker.<br><br>
The magic of the kingdom is powered by the <strong>Wellspring</strong>, the source of all magic in the whole universe. The Plumber, an unknown entity seemingly controlled by The Library, is able to turn off its magical flow, causing nearly all magic to cease. During these periods, only Travelers, Fairies, and Gods are still able to use magic. Niffins - who are made of pure magical energy - slowly die if the Wellspring is cut. If the water of the Wellspring is drunk, the person is given incredibly power, but at the expense of everyone else’s ability to draw from the depleted source. It does, however appear to be a <strong>self-replenishing source</strong>, meaning that as long as the Wellspring remains functional, Magic will be endless.<br><br>
The Wellspring is sealed by a circular golden door with a magical marble as the key. Because of its immense power, only <strong>Gods</strong>, <strong>God-touched magicians</strong>, and <strong>Master Magicians</strong> are able to touch it; anyone less would be scorched.</p>
        
<h3 id="gov">Government</h3>
<h4>Rulers</h4>
<p>Fillory has a <strong>tetrarchic</strong> system, with the High King acting as head of the government. As a whole, there must be <strong>two kings</strong> and <strong>two queens</strong>. Interestingly enough, these four roles must be filled by "Children of Earth." As a result of this rule, there was a period from (approximately) 1950 to 2016 where the Fillorians didn't have an official ruler.<br><br>
Ember was the one who created this rule for his own amusement. In the 1930s, he and his brother followed the <strong>Chatwin siblings</strong>, who would become the rulers after entering Fillory. Eventually, one of the brothers - Martin - was exiled by Ember but came back enraged, drank from the Wellspring to gain its power, and began ruling over Fillory under the moniker "The Beast."<br><br>
Although the current leadership isn't entirely clear, the most recent full set of rulers that Fillory had were:</p>
<ol>
	<li>High King Eliot the Spectacular (Eliot Waugh)
	<li>High Queen Margo the Destroyer (Margo Hanson)
	<li>King Quentin the Moderately Socially Maladjusted (Quentin Coldwater)
	<li>Queen Alice the Wise (Alice Quinn)
</ol>

<p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center"><em>Pictured are High Queen Margo, High King Eliot, Queen Alice, and King Eliot (left to right)</em></p>
<p>Those appointed High King are forbidden from ever leaving Fillory, although Eliot found a loophole by creating a golem in his image, sending it to Earth, and projecting his consciousness into the creature. This proved helpful, as he was able to assist them on a quest, until the golem was killed and he had to return full-time to his job on Fillory. Since then, he and Margo have been diligent rulers, or at least tried to be.<br><br>
Unfortunately for them, an invasion of fairies led to a sharp decline in their economy, which the commoners blamed on their rulers. In turn, they staged a revolt, with Eliot and Margo’s former adviser <strong>Tick</strong> taking on the role of king.<br><br>
Desperate to regain their position, Eliot ran a campaign against Tick, but the popular vote eventually went to Margo, who'd unintentionally gained the votes of <strong>nearly all talking animals</strong> across the kingdom. She accepted the title of High King, but unfortunately had to leave to complete a quest with Eliot and their friends. While she was gone, Eliot's wife - <strong>Fen</strong>, who he was legally bound to, but in a platonic relationship with - took on the role of acting High King. Most recently, Margo - along with the others - had their memories wiped and started up new lives on Earth, so it's not clear whether her title still stands.</p>
<h4 id="allegiances">Relationships</h4>
<p>Over the course of High King Eliot's reign, their two major alliances were with <strong>Loria</strong> and the <strong>Tribe of the Floating Mountain</strong>.<br><br>
Loria is currently ruled by <strong>King Idri</strong> and his son, <strong>Prince Ess</strong>. Originally, Prince Ess approached High Queen Margo to ask for her hand in marriage, but after discovering that he's tricked her, she refused. This dispute led King Idri and High King Eliot to engage in a battle to the death, but the two of them struck a deal: rather than killing each other, they decided to marry and split control of the Wellspring between them.<br><br>
The Tribe of the Floating Mountain - which is no longer floating - is ruled by <strong>Agate Grey</strong>, also known as the <em>Stone Queen</em>. She arranged a marriage between High Queen Margo and her eldest son, <strong>Micah</strong>, in the hopes of forging an alliance. Although Margo was originally opposed, she learned that the Tribe is a matriarchal society and thus saw the wedding in a better light. She agreed, but as they were standing at the altar, Micah was murdered by a swinging axe. His younger brother, <strong>Fomar</strong>, who was only fifteen years old, stepped in and took Micah's place as Margo's husband.<br><br>
Although the relationships between these nations and Fillory were on the rocks briefly during the revolt, they were back on friendly - or at least neutral - terms after Margo gained the title of High King.<br><br>
Fillory’s standing with the <strong>fairy folk</strong> also underwent some major changes. For a considerable period of time, they were invaded by fairies and were forced to do much of their bidding, which directly led to their economic collapse. Since the fairies are only visible to those who have conducted a deal with them, the commoners and most of the staff were unaware that their High King and Queen were being forced to make the questionable decisions they made. The <strong>Fairy Queen</strong> took Margo’s right eye and Fen’s toes to make sure they were under her control. Eventually, however, Fen and Julia Wicker convinced the Queen to help them <strong>free the enslaved fairies</strong> living on Earth, and this put humans and fairies on much more even ground. The Queen agreed to leave them be and later sacrificed her life in order to ensure that all fairies would be protected by law from being hunted.</p>
